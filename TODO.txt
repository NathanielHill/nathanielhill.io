Ideas for making website awesome:

1) Have lighting effects on my face change with mouse movement (e.g. the cursor is a light source). (https://css-tricks.com/look-svg-light-source-filters/)
2) SMS/Chat style popups from my avatar while browsing site
3) Intercom style contact/email/chat UI to encourage contacts (invisible captcha)
4) Fluid typography (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/fluid-typography/)
5) Awesome page transitions (https://github.com/xavczen/nextjs-page-transitions)
6) Awesome animations in general! (gsap)
7) Great about page explaining cool things about site
8) Fork Me github overlay?
9) Have awesome layout changes at various screen sizes (a la https://lynnandtonic.com/)
10) Have eyelids close after inactivity and then matrix rain starts as screensaver/dream sequence
11) Have eyelids open and an avatar reaction on resumption
12) Interactive conversation pieces (avatar ai?)
13) Have awesome resizing demo, but only have it turn on after prompting from avatar. Make it disable-able as well! (This way landing on the site is predictable UX)
14) Have avatar interactively showcase site awesomeness (e.g. Wow! I sure loaded fast at 14.7ms DCL... FPS, CPU usage, etc...)
15) Avatar quizes/polls? (have poll-id as query string and prompt/tally polls I come up with?)
16) Have a special query string for recruiters/interviewers/job applications that gives customized greeting and highlights why they should hire me!!
17) Have a loading progress "ring" on outside of avatar circle... (with light source doing a 360??)
18) Add NPM social icon to website to show published packages
